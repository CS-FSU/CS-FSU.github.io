<h2 id="description"><u>Description</u></h2>
Graph data is ubiquitous across a plethora of real-world applications. Correspondingly, graph machine learning algorithms have become popular tools in helping us gain a deeper understanding of these graphs. Despite their effectiveness, most graph machine learning algorithms lack considerations for fairness, which can result in discriminatory outcomes against certain demographic subgroups or individuals. As a result, there is a growing societal concern about mitigating the bias exhibited in these algorithms. To tackle the problem of algorithmic bias in graph machine learning algorithms, this tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent research progress in measuring and mitigating the bias in machine learning algorithms on graphs. Specifically, this tutorial first introduces several widely-used fairness notions and the corresponding metrics. Then, we present a well-organized theoretical understanding of bias in graph machine learning algorithms, followed by a summary of existing techniques to debias graph machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate how different real-world applications benefit from these graph machine learning algorithms after debiasing. Finally, we provide insights on current research challenges and open questions to encourage further advances.
