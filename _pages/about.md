I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/) working with [Prof. Jundong Li](http://www.ece.virginia.edu/~jl6qk/).

<span style="color:red">**I am currently on the academic job market. Please kindly reach out for any opportunities.**</span>

My research interest mainly lies in achieving responsible AI to further advance social good such as facilitating inclusive decision-making. I perform abundant research in related areas focusing on relational data, such as advancing the explainability, algorithmic fairness, and safety of deep learning. There are 27 published research papers (nine first author ones) focusing on the following areas [[see full list]](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=_QUhuOMAAAAJ):

* **Explainability:** Model Interpretability; Prediction Justification  
* **Algorithmic Fairness:** Fairness measurement; Algorithm Debiasing  
* **Safety:** Attacks and Defenses  
* **AI/ML+X (Applications):** Healthcare; Recommendation  

I also received **Louis T. Rader Graduate Research Award**, **Endowed Fellowship**, and **Best Poster (Runner Up) @Doctoral Forum of SDM 2022**. I am truly grateful for the generuous efforts from the associated institutions and organizers.



<!-- I have abundant interest in **Graph Mining**, e.g., **Spectral Graph Theory**, **Graph Neural Networks** and corresponding interdisciplinary topics. -->

<!-- My previous research experiences mainly lie in graph mining and feature fusion. -->
