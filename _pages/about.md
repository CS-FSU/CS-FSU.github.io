I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/), now working with [Prof. Jundong Li](http://www.ece.virginia.edu/~jl6qk/). Prior to joining in UVa, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the School of Information and Communication Engineering at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) (BUPT), where I worked with [Prof. Yingxia Shao](https://shaoyx.github.io/) and [Prof. Wensheng Sun](https://bkso.baidu.com/item/%E5%AD%99%E6%96%87%E7%94%9F/23658543). (Last updated Aug. 2021)

Research Interests
---

I always envision the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) deployed in real-world applications to be socially beneficial, accountable, and reliable to people. Correspondingly, my research interests are mainly in the trustworthiness of GNNs, e.g., algorithmic fairness and interpretability. 

<!-- I have abundant interest in **Graph Mining**, e.g., **Spectral Graph Theory**, **Graph Neural Networks** and corresponding interdisciplinary topics. -->

<!-- My previous research experiences mainly lie in graph mining and feature fusion. -->
