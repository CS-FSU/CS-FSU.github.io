<h1>ICDM 2022 Tutorial: Fairness in Graph Mining: Metrics, Algorithms, and Applications</h1>

<h2 id="description"><u>Description</u></h2>
Graph data is ubiquitous in diverse real-world applications. To gain a deeper understanding of these graphs, graph mining algorithms have been playing a significant role over the years. Nevertheless, most graph mining algorithms lack fairness consideration. As a consequence, they could render discriminatory results against certain demographic subgroups or individuals. Such potential discrimination leads to an increasing societal concern about alleviating the bias exhibited in graph mining algorithms. In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent research progress in measuring and mitigating the bias exhibited in graph mining algorithms. Specifically, we first introduce several widely-used fairness notions and the corresponding metrics. Then, we present an organized summary of existing techniques to debias graph mining algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate how different real-world applications benefit from these graph mining algorithms after debiasing. Finally, we provide insights on current research challenges and open questions to encourage further advances.
